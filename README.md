# Investigate-Movies-Dataset

Project: Investigate-Movies-Dataset

I have movies data set from different years with some information's as their budget, revenue, casts etc... We will do some analysis practices starting by assessing the data quality and then fix some of data. Then explore it and visualize it and draw some conclusions.

Questions to address:

Does the movies always financially success ?
For filmmakers, does the people become hard to satisfy by the time?
What do people prefer ? Action or Comedy movies ?
